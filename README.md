# creating my own token

creating a token and using functions to mint and burn tokens.

## Description

In this assessment, I have created a token using three variables and then mapped the address to an integer value. I have created a function named mint that takes the address as a parameter and the amount of tokens that need to be minted. This function also increments the value of the variables in it. Additionally, I have created another function, burn, that burns the minted tokens. However, it first checks if the amount that needs to be burned is less than the available tokens in the wallet address. It also updates the values of the token variables.
